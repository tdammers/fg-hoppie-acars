FG Hoppie ACARS Addon
=====================

What Is This?
-------------
This is an add-on for FlightGear, which implements an ACARS system based on
Hoppie's ACARS (http://www.hoppie.nl/acars/).

What It Does
------------
Right now, not much. Loading the add-on will create a Nasal object,
`globals.acars`, which can connect to Hoppie's server and send and retrieve
raw ACARS messages.
